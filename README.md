# Chat with Astro Bot the genomics explorer!  

## Summary  

This is a project to create a 'chatbot' learning tool using a library of genomics information with a RAG-LLM and conversation history/memory- so that people can query it with questions about genomics and oxidative stress in order to learn more about the kinds of things I/my lab research.

## Requirements  

- bash and curl or wget (one required for downloading installers/models).  
- Approximately 45 GB of RAM (preferably GPU VRAM). Running with less than 45 GB of VRAM will result in very slow answers (bot could take up to a couple minutes per query).  
- Tested on:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 (native and WSL)
  - Rocky Linux 8.10

## Running the pipeline (*pipeline.sh*)  

__*Important:*__ *pipeline.sh* must be sourced (not executed) so it can export and activate the conda/mamba environment into your current shell session. 

Use:
```source pipeline.sh [options]```

Why source? The install step (*install-mamba-and-ollama.sh*) sets up a conda/mamba environment and *pipeline.sh* activates that environment and exports variables that the rest of the session needs. Running *pipeline.sh* in a subshell (```bash ./pipeline.sh```) will not preserve those environment changes in the running shell.

### Basic workflow examples  
- Run install-only (perform installation of necessary dependencies and build Chroma db only):  
```source pipeline.sh -i```

- Run chat-only (skip installation steps if already configured and start the chat interface):  
```source pipeline.sh -c```

### Custom installation paths  
- pipeline.sh supports options to set custom installation locations for mamba and ollama. Example usage (replace with the exact option names found at the top of pipeline.sh if they differ):  
```source pipeline.sh -m /custom/mamba/path -o /custom/ollama/path```

## Notes and troubleshooting  
- See the top of pipeline.sh for the exact option names and any additional flags it supports.
- Always source *pipeline.sh* in the same shell where you want to run the chat or other commands that rely on the activated environment.
